\section{The Fourier transform}

The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time into its component
frequencies. Each of these frequencies is part of what's called a
\textit{basis}. These waveforms can be added together in linear combinations to
produce the original signal. That is, we create a sum of waveforms that are
multiplied by their respective contribution amount.

Think of an Fmajor4 chord which has the notes $F_4$ ($349.23\,Hz$), $A_4$
($440\,Hz$), and $C_4$ ($261.63\,Hz$). The waveform over time looks like figure
\ref{fig:fourier_chord}.

Notice how this complex waveform can be represented just by three frequencies.
They show up as Dirac delta functions\footnote{The Dirac delta function is zero
everywhere except near the origin. The nonzero region has an infinitesimal width
and a height such that the area within that region is $1$.} in the frequency
domain with the area underneath them equal to their contribution (see figure
\ref{fig:fourier_chord_fft}).

In summary, the Fourier transform provides a way for us to determine, given some
signal, what frequencies can we add together and in what amounts to produce the
original signal.
