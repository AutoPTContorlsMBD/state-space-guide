\section{Steady-state error covariance matrix}

One may have noticed that the error covariance matrix can be updated
independently of the rest of the model. The error covariance matrix tends
toward a steady-state value, and this matrix can be obtained via the discrete
algebraic Ricatti equation. This can then be used to compute a steady-state
Kalman gain.

Snippet \ref{lst:kalman} computes the steady-state matrices for a Kalman
filter.
