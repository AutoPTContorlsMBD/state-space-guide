\chapter{State-space model examples}

Up to now, we've just been teaching what tools are available. Now, we'll go into
specifics on how to apply them and provide advice on certain applications.

The \gls{model} examples are intended to walk the reader through the
implementation steps described in section \ref{sec:implementation_steps}. The
code shown in each example can be obtained from frccontrol's Git repository at
\url{https://github.com/calcmogul/frccontrol/tree/master/examples}. See appendix
\ref{ch:installing_python_packages} for setup instructions.

The \glspl{model} derived here should cover most types of motion seen on an FRC
robot. Furthermore, they can be easily tweaked to describe many types of
mechanisms just by pattern-matching. There's only so many ways to hook up a mass
to a motor in FRC. The flywheel \gls{model} can be used for spinning mechanisms,
the elevator \gls{model} can be used for spinning mechanisms transformed to
linear motion, and the single-jointed arm \gls{model} can be used for rotating
servo mechanisms (it's just the flywheel \gls{model} augmented with a position
\gls{state}).

These \glspl{model} assume all motor controllers driving DC brushed motors are
set to brake mode instead of coast mode. Brake mode behaves the same as coast
mode except where the applied voltage is zero. In brake mode, the motor leads
are shorted together to prevent movement. In coast mode, the motor leads are an
open circuit.
