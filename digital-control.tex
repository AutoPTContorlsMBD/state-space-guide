\chapter{Digital control} \label{ch:digital_control}

The complex plane discussed so far deals with continuous \glspl{system}. In
decades past, \glspl{plant} and controllers were implemented using analog
electronics, which are continuous in nature. Nowadays, microprocessors can be
used to achieve cheaper, less complex controller designs. \Gls{discretization}
converts the continuous \gls{model} we've worked with so far from a set of
differential equations like

\begin{equation}
  \dot{x} = x - 3 \label{eq:differential_equ_example}
\end{equation}

to a set of difference equations like

\begin{equation}
  x_{k+1} = x_k + (x_k - 3) \Delta T \label{eq:difference_equ_example}
\end{equation}

where the difference equation is run with some update period denoted by $T$, by
$\Delta T$, or sometimes sloppily by $dt$.

While higher order terms of a differential equation are derivatives of the
\gls{state} variable (e.g., $\ddot{x}$ in relation to equation
(\ref{eq:differential_equ_example})), higher order terms of a difference
equation are delayed copies of the \gls{state} variable (e.g., $x_{k-1}$ with
respect to $x_k$ in equation (\ref{eq:difference_equ_example})).
