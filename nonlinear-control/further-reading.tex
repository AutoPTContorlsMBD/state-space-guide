\section{Further reading}

For learning more about nonlinear control, we recommend reading the book
\textit{Applied Nonlinear Control} by Jean-Jacques Slotine. For a more complex
type of nonlinear control, read \textit{A guiding vector field algorithm for
path following control of nonholonomic mobile robots} \cite{bib:gvf}.
