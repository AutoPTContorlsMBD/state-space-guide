\section{Linear algebra}

Modern control theory borrows concepts from linear algebra. At first, linear
algebra may appear very abstract, but there are simple geometric intuitions
underlying it. First, watch 3Blue1Brown's preview video for the
\textit{Essence of Linear Algebra} video series \cite{bib:linalg_preview}. The
goal here is to provide an intuitive, geometric understanding of linear algebra
as a method of linear transformations. \\

\subsection{Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors}

\subsection{Linear transformations and matrices}

\subsection{Matrix multiplication as composition}

\subsection{Miscellaneous notation}

The $^T$ in $\mtx{A}^T$ denotes transpose, which flips the matrix across its
diagonal such that the rows become columns and vice versa.
