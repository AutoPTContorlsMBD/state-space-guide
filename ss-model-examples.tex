\chapter{State-space model examples}

These examples are intended to walk the reader through the implementation steps
described in section \ref{sec:implementation-steps}. The code shown in each
example can be obtained from frccontrol's Git repository at
\url{https://github.com/calcmogul/frccontrol/tree/master/examples}.
See appendix \ref{ch:app-installing-python-control} for setup instructions.

The models derived here should cover most types of motion seen on an FRC robot.
Furthermore, they can be easily tweaked to describe many types of mechanisms
just by pattern-matching. There's only so many ways to hook up a mass to a motor
in FRC. The flywheel model can be used for spinning mechanisms, the elevator
model can be used for spinning mechanisms transformed to linear motion, and the
single-jointed arm model can be used for rotating servo mechanisms (it's just
the flywheel model augmented with a position state).

These models assume all motor controllers driving DC brushed motors are set to
brake mode instead of coast mode.
