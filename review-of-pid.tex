\section{PID basics and theory}

Negative feedback loops drive the difference between the \gls{reference} and
\gls{output} to zero.

\textbf{Proportional} gain compensates for current \gls{error}. \\
\textbf{Integral} gain compensates for past error (i.e.,
\gls{steady-state error}). \\
\textbf{Derivative} gain compensates for future error by slowing controller down
  if error decreases over time.

\section{Types of PID controllers}

PID controller inputs of different orders of derivatives, such as position and
velocity, affect the \gls{system} response differently. Below is the standard
form for a position PID controller.

\begin{definition}[Position PID controller]
  \begin{equation}
    u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{de}{dt}
    \label{def:pos_pid}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

If the controller is measuring and controlling velocity instead, the control
input $u(t)$ becomes $\frac{du}{dt}$ and the error $e(t)$ becomes
$\frac{de}{dt}$. Substituting these into equation (\ref{def:pos_pid}) yields

\begin{align}
  \frac{du}{dt} &= K_p \frac{de}{dt} + K_i \int_0^t \frac{de}{d\tau} d\tau +
    K_d \frac{d^2e}{dt^2} \nonumber \\
  \frac{du}{dt} &= K_p \frac{de}{dt} + K_i e(t) + K_d \frac{d^2e}{dt^2}
\end{align}

This shows that the proportional action ($K_p$) of a velocity controller is
caused by the integral action ($K_i$) of a position controller. The derivative
action ($K_i$) of a velocity controller is caused by the proportional action
($K_p$) of a position controller. Integral action ($K_i$) of a velocity
controller has no equivalent in the position formulation. If we were to
implement one, it would use a double integral.

Since for the velocity controller, the proportional term is controlled by an
integral action and the derivative term is controlled by a proportional action,
the coefficients can be relabelled as follows.

\begin{theorem}[Velocity PID controller]
  \begin{equation}
    u = K_p \int_0^t e(\tau) d\tau + K_d e(t)
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Integral control for the velocity is analogous to the throttle pedal on a car.
One must hold the throttle pedal (the control input) at a nonzero value to keep
the car traveling at the reference velocity.

PID control theory.

\section{PID control in terms of general control theory}

PID control defines \textit{setpoint} as the desired position and
\textit{process value} as the measured position. Control theory has more general
terms for these: \gls{reference} and \gls{output} respectively.

The derivative term is commonly used to ``slow down" the system if it's already
heading toward the \gls{reference}. We will explore what $K_p$ and $K_d$ are
really doing for a two-state system (position and velocity) and why $K_d$ acts
that way.

First, we will rearrange the equation for a PD controller.

\begin{equation*}
  u = K_p e_k + K_d \frac{e_k - e_{k-1}}{dt}
\end{equation*}

where $u$ is the control input and $e_k$ is the error at timestep $k$. $e_k$ is
defined as $e_k = r_k - x_k$ where $r_k$ is the reference and $x_k$ is the
current state at timestep $k$.

\begin{align*}
  u &= K_p (r_k - x_k) + K_d \frac{(r_k - x_k) - (r_{k-1} - x_{k-1})}{dt} \\
  u &= K_p (r_k - x_k) + K_d \frac{r_k - x_k - r_{k-1} + x_{k-1}}{dt} \\
  u &= K_p (r_k - x_k) + K_d \frac{r_k - r_{k-1} - x_k + x_{k-1}}{dt} \\
  u &= K_p (r_k - x_k) + K_d \frac{(r_k - r_{k-1}) - (x_k - x_{k-1})}{dt} \\
  u &= K_p (r_k - x_k) + K_d \left(\frac{r_k - r_{k-1}}{dt} -
    \frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{dt}\right)
\end{align*}

Notice how $\frac{r_k - r_{k-1}}{dt}$ is the velocity of the reference. By the
same reasoning, $\frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{dt}$ is the system's velocity at a given
timestep. That means the $K_d$ term is driving the estimated velocity to the
reference velocity. If the reference is constant, that means the $K_d$ term is
trying to drive the velocity of the system to zero, but it can't because $K_p$
is trying to make the system move and $K_p$ and $K_d$ are controlling the same
actuator. If $K_p$ is larger than $K_d$, one is in effect slowing down the
response of the controller during transients with the hope of decreasing
overshoot and settling time. If one makes $K_d$ much larger than $K_p$, $K_d$
overpowers $K_p$ to bring the system to a stop. However, when the velocity is
low enough, $K_p$ is stronger and starts accelerating the system again. This
oscillatory behavior in the velocity repeats as the system moves toward the
reference.

\section{Limitations of PID control}

PID's heuristic method of tuning is fine when there is no knowledge of the
\gls{system}. However, controllers with much better response can be developed if
a \glslink{model}{dynamical model} of the \gls{system} is known.
