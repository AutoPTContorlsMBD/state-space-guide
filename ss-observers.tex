\chapter{State-space observers}

State-space observers are used to estimate \glspl{state} which cannot be
measured directly. This can be due to noisy measurements or the state not being
measurable.

``LQE" stands for ``Linear-Quadratic Estimator". Similar to LQR, it places the
estimator poles such that it minimizes the sum of squares of the error. The
Luenberger observer and Kalman filter are examples of these.
