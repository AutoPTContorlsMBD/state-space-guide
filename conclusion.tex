\section{Conclusion}

While this guide is not comprehensive, you will hopefully have learned enough to
either implement these concepts yourself or know where to look for more
information. I hope this guide has enabled you to design and implement
performant, \glslink{robustness}{robust} controllers for a variety of robotic
applications.
