\section{What is control theory?}

How can we prove an autonomous car will behave safely and meet certain
performance specifications in the presence of uncertainty? Control theory is a
pragmatic application of algebra and geometry that is used to analyze and
predict the behavior of \glspl{system} such as these, make them respond how we
want them to, and make them \glslink{robustness}{robust} to \glspl{disturbance}
and uncertainty.

But what sets control theory apart from, say, applied math? While control theory
does have some beautiful math behind it, controls engineering is an engineering
discipline like any other that is filled with trade-offs. The solutions control
theory gives should always be sanity checked and informed by our performance
specifications. We don't need to be perfect; we just need to be good enough to
meet our specifications.
