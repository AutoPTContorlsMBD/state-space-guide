\section{Request for feedback}

While we have tried to write a book that makes the topics of control theory
approachable, it still may be dense or fast-paced for some readers (it covers
three classes of feedback control, two of which are for graduate students, in
one short book). Please send us feedback, corrections, or suggestions through
the GitHub link listed on the copyright page. New examples that demonstrate key
concepts and make them more accessible are also appreciated.
