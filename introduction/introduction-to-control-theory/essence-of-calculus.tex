\section{Essence of calculus}

This book uses derivatives and integrals occasionally to represent small changes
in values and the infintessimal sum of values over time respectively. If you
aren't already familiar with these concepts, 3Blue1Brown does a fantastic job of
introducing them in his \textit{Essence of calculus} video series
\cite{bib:essence_of_calculus}. We recommend watching videos 1 through 3 and 7
through 11 from that playlist for a solid foundation. The Taylor series
(presented in video 11) will be used in chapter \ref{ch:digital_control}.
